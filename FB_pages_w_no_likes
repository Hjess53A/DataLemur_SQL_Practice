-- If we are looking for the page id of a page with no likes, then the page_id were looking for shouldn't be on the page_likes table

SELECT p.page_id
FROM pages p
LEFT JOIN page_likes pl
ON p.page_id = pl.page_id
WHERE pl.page_id IS NULL
ORDER BY p.page_id ASC

-- Checking if the results (20701, 32728) are accurate

--checking the number
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT page_id)
FROM page_likes
-- results is 3

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM pages
-- result is 5, 5-3= 2 pages that haven't been liked similar to number to our query

-- results should not be on the page_likes table, checking
SELECT page_id
FROM page_likes
WHERE page_id IN (20701, 32728)
-- no output displayed
